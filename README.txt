Project: Water rendering through texture displacement

Owner Name: Jose Antonio Frias Castillo

Controls:

-   Controls will be shown in an ImGui window when the program is run

Executable:

- It shows a demo that includes a simulation of a sea where you can control the waves parameters
to simulate different situations such as the ones explained in the report paper, where you can 
see the process and conclusions of this method compared to other ones.

Enjoy!

Disclaimer: due to the lack of correct wave height maps in the internet for free, the current wave
height maps that I'm using are not fully tileable, that's the reason why a visual artifact appears 
going from one side to the other (and also in the other direction, since there are two wave height 
maps affecting the sea in opposite directions each one that you can switch which one has more effect
on the sea, just so you know why there is a visual artifact that is specially visible with high waves).
